    <h2>Foundations Core Skills Reflection</h2>
    <h3 class="core-heading">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
        I don’t consider myself an egotistical person (who does really) but I still found myself feeling pretty embarrassed when I spent a lot of time looking for an issue in my code only to find it was a small avoidable syntax error. Reflecting about that helped me realize that my ego will always be there, it’s about keeping in mind that it’s okay to fail and make mistakes as long as I learn from them. 
    </p>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
        I’ve also found through my core learning, that using core skills is a great help for my confidence about my coding ability. In my past experiences with learning, I’ve had those days where I doubt myself a lot more frequently. While those doubts and delays still happen when things don’t seem to be going my way, I’m generally feeling a lot more confident about how I’m doing in this course than in my previous learning. 
    </p>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
        Finally I learned about my emotional intelligence and how realistic the possibility is of consciously developing it through reflective action. EQ has always been something I’ve thought more of as a background quality that develops without us really noticing it, but it’s not like that. Through conscious thought it can be developed.
    </p>


    <h3 class="core-heading">What are the role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
        These three concepts are crucial in the career development of a budding (or experienced) web programmer. People with a strong sense for theses concepts can relate better to others and understand how to fit into a team or work and communicate positively with others. In learning and programming, working together with a cohort is a vital skill as it combines the resourcefulness of multiple parties instead of just the one. 
    </p>

    
    <h3 class="core-heading">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
        Having spent a bit of time studying education and university, I was surprised by how much of the core content was familiar to me. I figured a lot of the core concepts would be more specific to coding but it’s more like a collection of general education concepts framed in a coding context.
    </p>

    <h3 class="core-heading">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
        The most challenging aspects for me were the ones that involved self-evaluation. Finding my identity and writing about my core values was quite difficult for me, as it’s not something I’ve often thought about. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="core-heading">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
        EDA has stated that their primary goal for its students is to get them in a position where they are ready to start their careers in the tech industry, that is to make them as employable as possible. In any workplace, the skills that develop with core learning are essential as they determine how capable an employee is at fitting in comfortably in the workplace and developing their industry specific skills to new heights. For EDA it’s the concept of teaching learning. Creating web developers who have the skills to reflect and learn from themselves and the skills to teach themselves, as well as learning from others in their careers.
    </p>

    <h3 class="core-heading">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
        I think I benefitted from the time I spent on core learning during foundations. Taking the time to reflect on my learning and think about what I’d learned was something I believe helped drive home the lessons I was taking from each exercise and challenge. Setting aside some time specifically to do this was excellent and partaking in the core exercises (thinking about the prompt questions and actually writing my answers down) was helpful as it unlikely that I would have taken the time otherwise.

    <h2>Follow Up Questions - Preparing for Bootcamp</h2>

    <h3 class="core-heading">What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
      Over the next 20 years I would like to work my way to becoming an experienced web developer and find a role/s that allows to visit and experience a variety of countries. Whether this entails working remotely or finding new roles overseas is uncertain.
    </p>
    

    <h3 class="core-heading">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
      I still believe in the strengths and limitations I identified for myself in sprint 2. I think foundations has reinforced my belief that I can ask for help when I need it and be open to taking on feedback and advice. I still think I will be limited in showing confidence and perhaps take too much of a backseat role when it comes to group/pair work. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="core-heading">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
      I would say staying on top of the workload. The plan is currently to move in with a good mate from school and I will be living nearby several other good mates as well. I’m eager to maintain an active social life while in Wellington but I need to be careful not to let it keep me from staying well on top of my work at bootcamp.
    </p>

    <h3 class="core-heading">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
      I think I would to challenge myself to develop my leadership skills and contribute more in a group work setting. This means taking the reigns where possible and being more vocal about my thoughts and ideas, as these are things I often keep to myself. I would also like to make an effort to give out more feedback to others in my cohort. As a learner myself, it often feels as though it’s not my place to give feedback (constructive criticism in particular), but there have been times in bootcamp where members of my cohort have given me helpful criticisms, and I would like help others in this way as well.
    </p>

    <h3 class="core-heading">What are your expectations of yourself on bootcamp?</h3>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
      On bootcamp I intend to keep on top of my work by keeping in regular contact with my cohort and teachers. Talking with my cohort and discussing the work we’re doing will help to keep me in the loop about what’s going on and serve as an outlet for me to ask questions and develop an understanding of the course content. For big queries I or when I need expert help I’ll ask for help from one of my teachers.
