    <h2>Core 2 - Reflection Questions</h2>
    <h2 class="core-heading">What is your long-term goal and or career pathway?</h2>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
      My main career goal is to have skills that will allow me to work around the 
      world. Working in the tech industry, I hope to travel to and work in a variety of countries.
    </p><br><br>

        
    <h2 class="core-heading">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
    <p class="core-paragraph">I would like to see development of my confidence in my identity. At this stage I still struggle to 
      identify important aspects of my character. Building my self-confidence and knowledge about who I am to myself and others is
      something I would love to do while studying with EDA.
    </p><br><br>


    <h2 class="core-heading">A description of your own strengths and limitations</h2>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
      I believe my greatest strength is my openness to learning opportunities. I greatly value the advice of 
      others and position myself as a learner. I also think I work well and communicate constructively in a team environment.
    </p>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
      I am limited when it comes to showing leadership in a team environment. I need to push myself to take the lead in situations
      where I should and tend to let someone else take the lead if the option is there.
    </p><br><br>

    <h2 class="core-heading">Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</h2>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
      The most important thing for me in keeping on top of the workload is making sure I don’t lose my rhythm. For
      me this means coding every day. If I go a day or two without any coding it takes a bit longer to get into the flow of it again.
    </p>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
      In order to help myself work well the other students and facilitators in foundations, I’m making sure to keep myself in the loop
      on the slack chat. Staying in the loop for me involves checking the chat regularly, reading the progress others are making on 
      their blogs and helping solve others’ problems when possible as well as asking for help in solving my own problems.
    </p><br><br>

    <h2 class="core-heading">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
      When I need help that google isn’t offering, I intend to ask the foundations channel on Slack. I’ve already 
      done this once, and I quickly received the solution to my problem. Going into Javascript in sprint 3 I expect it to happen several
      more times haha. I also would like to offer my own help to others in the channel where I can.
    </p><br><br>


    <h2 class="core-heading">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
      As their title suggests, the facilitators are there to facilitate my learning. Keeping in regular contact and
      being available for help/guidance when I ask is what I expect of them for foundations.
    </p><br><br>


    <h2 class="core-heading">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in</h2>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
      Currently due to the lockdown I have no other time sensitive commitments however, with the shift to level 3 happening
      on the 28th I will be going back to work for two days a week. My usual permanent hours are Sunday and Monday, 10-5 and 11-7 respectively,
      but my usual admin duties are unlikely to need doing during level 3 of lockdown so I’m uncertain about what hours I will be working. I 
      will update this in a few days when I find out more.
    </p><br>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
      Update: I returned to work on 03/05 and will be working every Sunday and Monday from 10-5 and 11-7 respectively for the rest of foundations.
