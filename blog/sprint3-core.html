            <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
            <h3 class="core-heading">What is emotional intelligence?</h3>
            <p class="core-paragraph">-	Emotional intelligence is the measure of a person’s ability to identify and manage their own emotions.
                 It is an awareness of one’s own feelings and how they can affect or be affected by their emotions. It also extends to awareness
                  of the emotions of others around them and how their emotions are affected by events. Emotional intelligence is linked to 
                  several valuable skills in personal and professional life including effective communication, conflict defusal and leadership ability. </p>

            <h3 class="core-heading">How is it different to IQ?</h3>
            <p class="core-paragraph">-	High EQ is more to do with knowledge of oneself and the ability to observe and learn more about the self and others
                 emotionally. EQ is related to skills and abilities that consider real world context, accounting for the individuality of the people, 
                 environment and situations.</p>
            <p class="core-paragraph">IQ is a measure of someone’s intelligence when it comes to academic knowledge and skills. IQ is measured by a series of 
                standardized tests and doesn’t necessarily take real world applications and contexts into account, focusing more on theoretical situations.</p>
            <h3 class="core-heading">Why is it important?</h3>
            <p class="core-paragraph">-	Having a high EQ has a much stronger correlation to workplace and personal success than IQ does. This is because high 
                EQ is linked to good management, work ethic, teamwork and leadership skills. People with a higher EQ are more adept at managing their emotions
                 and acting to secure better emotional outcomes for themselves and others. People with a high IQ may not have the necessary emotional skills
                  to apply their academic knowledge in meaningful contexts, skills which are crucial to advancing and succeeding in a work environment and many
                   aspects of one’s personal life. </p>
