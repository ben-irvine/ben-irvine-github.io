    <h2>Core 1 - Identity, Values and Strength Activity</h2>
    <h3 class="core-heading">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
        In my first year at University I lived in one of the halls with a group of people I got along well with. One of our group had some 
        social and emotional issues as well as some problems with self-control, occasionally becoming violent at the worst of times.  
        Throughout the year we tried to support him in various ways. At the end of the year most of us decided to go flatting together 
        and the dilemma arose on whether to invite him or not. He didn’t have other friends and he would no doubt struggle even more 
        starting over with strangers again, as he seemed more comfortable with us than elsewhere. We decided to invite him to flat with us for the year.
        I no longer live with him, but I believe that living with helped him in the long run in dealing with some of the issues he faces. 
        It was a complicated situation, but I like to think that my empathy helped me to make the right choice in this situation.
    </p><br><br>

    <h3 class="core-heading">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
        My culture growing up has developed me into a person who primarily values honesty, empathy and humility. I believe that a great deal
        of everyday social tensions and differences stem from a lack of proper communication or lack of honesty. My cultural influences have
        taught me the value of empathy and how beneficial it can be for your personal or professional relationships by making a conscious 
        attempt to understand how those around you are feeling. My folks raised me in an environment that taught me humility, and the 
        importance of taking pride in yourself without becoming arrogant.
    </p><br><br>

    <h3 class="core-heading">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
        I believe my greatest workplace strengths are my openness to learn, my easy-goingness and empathy. I am very open to feedback on
        my work and am comfortable asking questions and positioning myself as a learner. While working in group settings, I’m quite relaxed
        and get along well with most people. Should tensions arise, I try my best to take a constructive approach and 
        sort through the tension respectfully.
    </p> 
    <p class="core-paragraph">
        My greatest limitation in a work environment is my confidence, as I often take my modesty too far in my self-evaluation and 
        tend to undersell myself and my achievements. Another limitation of mine is my tendency to be a perfectionist. While I believe
        strongly in quality over quantity, I have in the past taken this too far and spent more time than necessary ‘perfecting’ my work.
    </p><br><br>

    <h3 class="core-heading">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
        I believe my openness to learning will be a great help in my learning. There are plenty of knowledgeable people both in the student cohort
        and the EDA staff. Seeking out and listening to their advice will help me develop into a successful programmer. I’m hoping my 
        easygoingness and empathy make it easy for me to establish positive working relationships within my cohort. 
    </p><br><br>

    <h3 class="core-heading">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
        While studying at University, I ended up in group project with three others I hardly knew, two of whom were well known to dislike each other. 
        It had a bit of an impact on the groups success at working together so me I brought it up with the other team member and we discussed it. 
        We decided to tell the two who were fighting that we were going to go to our lecturer and ask if she could rearrange the groups. They agreed 
        that was best, so we explained to the lecturer and she swapped the groups around, which definitely helped our group’s productivity. In 
        hindsight I think what we did may have made for a better back up plan. If we’d handled it internally and told the two who were fighting 
        that they had to stop the fighting and keep it professional for our project I think we could have had a more positive result. Our solution
        was not one that can often be applied to this sort of issue and I think it could have worked better for everyone to handle it internally.
