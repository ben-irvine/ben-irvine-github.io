              <h2>CSS - Inline Display or Inline-Block Display</h2>
              <section>
                  <p class="info-paragraph">In CSS, the 'display' property influences how an element is shown on the page. The values 'inline' and 'inline-block' both place the element
                    on the same horizontal line as the element before itself (assuming there is space for it), so what is the difference?</p><br>
                  <h3>Default Display Values</h3>
                  <p>Starting with the basics of display:</p>

                  <p class="info-paragraph">Elements with a block display value possess an inherent line break, meaning they always start on a new line and always take up the whole line.
                     They can also have their height and width adjusted to better suit the layout of the page or the content of
                     the element. Default block elements include div, p, h1-h6, header, footer and section.</p><br>

                  <p class="info-paragraph">Elements with an inline display only take up as much space as needed for their content and their size cannot be altered. Inline elements can sit 
                      next to each other on the horizontal line or slot into other elements comfortably. Inline elements are useful for putting small additions into block level
                      elements e.g. using an anchor tag to put a link into a block level paragraph. Default inline elements include a (anchor), span and img.</p><br>

                  <h3>Inline-Block Elements</h3>
                  <p class="info-paragraph">Web developers can change the display of elements in CSS to change how to are shown. Giving an element an inline-block display value essentially 
                      turns it into a block element without the aforementioned inherent line break. This means its height and width can be altered and it can sit on
                      the same row as other inline or inline-block elements. This allows web developers to horizontally line up as many elements as they can fit on the page</p><br>
