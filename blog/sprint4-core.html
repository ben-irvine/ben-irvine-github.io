    <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
    <h3 class="core-heading">Neuroplasticity</h3>
    <p class="core-paragraph">
      The concept of neuroplasticity is one worth understanding as a learner. The brain has the potential 
      to develop its structure and capacity positively and people who understand this can help it by treating their mind and 
      body well. Maintaining good bodily and mental health is all about good habits. Things like exercise, diet, sleep and learning
      all come together to help brain plasticity and support a person’s overall health. 
    </p>

    <p class="core-paragraph">
      Supporting one’s neuroplasticity is best done through conscious action. To support my learning its best 
      to set real goals and consciously focus on achieving them, the overall goal being to turn these smaller goals into habits. Also,
      worth noting is the fact that if things don’t go completely according the set plans and the goals are not achieved, it’s important
      to not get discouraged and let it derail progress made in making or maintaining good habits.

    <h3 class="core-heading">Growth Mindset</h3>
            
    <p class="core-paragraph">
      The idea of neuroplasticity is also connected to research about growth and fixed mindsets. The way I see it, mindsets work 
      as a self-fulfilling prophecy. People tend to not aim any higher than the believe themselves capable. Someone who thinks their potential is 
      fixed and their brain just doesn’t have the capacity to learn a lot aren’t going to try. Those who recognize the plasticity of their brain 
      and understand that they can develop and achieve great things will aim higher and achieve higher. Through conscious thought and action, I can
      support the neuroplasticity of my brain and maintain a positive perspective on my ability to achieve highly.
