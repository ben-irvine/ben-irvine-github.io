    <h3 class="core-heading">An analogy to describe HTML and CSS differences</h3>
    <p class="info-paragraph">
      Creating a website with HTML and CSS can be compared to building a house.
      Writing the HTML code is making the blueprint of the house, while the CSS code is the interior 
      decoration designs. When all is ready, the plans are handed over to a builder/decorator named Browser, 
      who throws the whole thing together in a matter of seconds.

    <h3 class="core-heading">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h3>
    <p class="info-paragraph">
      What is control flow in Javascript and why is it important to know about as a Web Developer. 
      Writing Javascript is essentially writing a set of instructions for the computer to do and controlling the flow is 
      controlling the order and pathway of operations, the two handiest tools for this being if/else statements, and loops. 
      What these tools do is check certain criteria and act differently based on whether these criteria are met. 
    </p><br>

    <p class="info-paragraph">
      When crossing the road, I imagine you follow a flow of actions to make sure you get to the other side
      safely. First you check one way to see if it's clear, then the other. If it’s not clear, you act accordingly, waiting for 
      the car or cars to pass by. At this point you perform your checks again and follow this flow until both ways are clear. When
      this finally happens, you cross the street safely and the flow of events for crossing the street comes to an end. 
    </p><br>

    <p class="info-paragraph">
      This is a simple if/else loop. The action you perform depends on the set criteria, but it loops into you 
      repeating the criteria check until you can perform the desired action.
    </p><br><br>


    <h3 class="core-heading">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</h3>
    <p class="info-paragraph">
      The DOM is an interface within a web browser through which we can view webpages as tree structures, made up 
      of objects linking to their parent structures all the way back to a starting point. It is useful because it has a range of tools 
      that can be used to edit or experiment on web pages, including a console that allows us to interact with the webpage using Javascript 
      commands, allowing us to alter the pages structure, style and contents in response to certain 'events'. 
    </p><br>
    <p class="info-paragraph">
      Amongst these tools are a range of search functions, commands and listeners (code that listens for and reacts 
      to certain things happening like clicks or button pushes). With these commands an incredible range of unique features can be created
      to make a web page interactive and the DOM is a convenient window into experimentation and debugging these features.
    </p><br><br>

    <h3 class="core-heading">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>

    <p class="info-paragraph">
      Arrays are a collection of multiple values for a single variable, while an object is a variable that can be
      given multiple properties with different values. While these two datatypes seem similar, there are differences in how their 
      specific values are accessed and interacted with.
    </p>

    <p class="info-paragraph">
      From this array, if I wanted to create a new variable to with the value “Orange”, I would only need to name the array and refer to the entry number I need. Since arrays use a zero-index
      numbering system (It starts counting at zero instead of one), the “Orange” value is at number 1.
    </p>
    <img src="..\images\sprint3_technical\arrayselect.PNG"><br><br><br>

    <p class="info-paragraph">
      Objects are different however, as the contents of their brackets don’t just contain values, but properties as well. 
      These properties can have a variety of datatypes as their values, this object has a string, number and array as the values of its properties.
    </p><br>
    <img src="..\images\sprint3_technical\objectdeclare.PNG"><br><br><br><br>


    <p class="info-paragraph">
      If we wanted to create a variable with a number value of 8 from this object, we would use bracket or dot notation to specify which property from 
      the object we are wanting to return.</p>
    <img src="..\images\sprint3_technical\objectselect.PNG"><br><br>

    <p class="info-paragraph">
      Say we wanted to create a variable and assign one of the values from our array within our object. We would need to specify the ‘colours’ property 
      and give the index number of the value we want.</p>

    <h3 class="core-heading">Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h3>
    <p class="info-paragraph">
      In Javascript, a function is a sequence of code that is assigned to a chosen keyword that can be called on freely after being
      declared. ‘Declaring’ a function is simply stating the name of the function and writing out the code that the function will 
      execute. Once declared, a function can be executed by simply stating its name.
    </p><br>
    <p class="info-paragraph">
      Functions are incredibly useful as web developers and programmers frequently need to repeat various sequences of code. Once declared,
      functions are a great time saving shortcut for programmers, saving them from rewriting or copy and pasting their previous code sequences.
